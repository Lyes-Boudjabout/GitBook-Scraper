## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know.

### General

What does “lifetime access” mean exactly?

Tailwind Plus products are a **one-time purchase, with no recurring
subscription**. When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, you have access
to all of the content in that product forever.

What does “free updates” include?

When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, any improvements we make or new
content we add to that product will always be free for anyone who owns that
product.

**Individual component packages:** When you buy the Marketing, Application UI,
or Ecommerce component packages individually, you'll get any new components we
add to those packages in the future at no extra cost.

We regularly add new components to these packages whenever we have new ideas,
and you can see what previous updates have looked like [in our
changelog](/plus/changelog).

Any _new_ component packages we release are considered separate products, and
can be purchased at an upgrade price.

**Tailwind Plus:** When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access
to every component package _and_ every site template available today, plus any
additional component packages or templates we release in the future at no
additional cost.

This means that if we add a brand new component package like “Journalism” or
design a new social media website template, access to those products are
included in your original purchase, with no upgrade cost.

### Compatibility

Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?

No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.

We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our own design and
development process, so building these extra resources means we can't spend as
much time creating new examples in code which is where we believe we can
provide the most value.

What JS framework is used?

All of the components in Tailwind Plus are provided in three formats: React,
Vue, and vanilla HTML.

The React and Vue examples are fully functional out-of-the-box, and are
powered by [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev) — a library of unstyled
components we designed to integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.

The vanilla HTML examples **do not include any JavaScript** and are designed
for people who prefer to write any necessary JavaScript themselves.

Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the ones that do
(dropdowns, dialogs, etc.) we've provided some simple comments in the HTML to
explain things like what classes you need to use for different states (like a
toggle switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for transitioning
elements on to or off of the screen (like a dialog opening).

To get a better idea of how this looks in practice, [check out our
documentation](/plus/ui-blocks/documentation#using-html).

What version of Tailwind CSS is used?

Everything in Tailwind Plus is designed and developed for the latest version
of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.1.

What browsers are supported?

The components in Tailwind Plus are designed to work in the latest, stable
releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

We don't support Internet Explorer 11.

### Licensing

Can I upgrade to a team license later?

Yup! If you're a solo developer you can start with a personal license, and
then upgrade to the team license later if other developers join your team.

There is an "Upgrade to Team License" option under the "Account" menu after
logging in.

Note that we only offer team licenses for Tailwind Plus, and do not offer team
licenses for the individual component packages.

Do I need to purchase a license for each project I work on?

Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new Tailwind Plus
license every time you want to use it on a new project.

As long as what you're building is allowed as per the license, you can build
as many sites as you want without ever having to buy an additional license.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for client projects?

Yes! As long what you're building is a custom website developed for a single
client, you can totally use components and templates in Tailwind Plus to help
build it.

The only thing you can't do is use Tailwind Plus to build a website or
template that is resold to multiple clients.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for my own commercial projects?

Absolutely! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own
projects as you like, whether those are simple public websites or SaaS
applications that end users need to pay to access.

As long as what you’re building isn’t a website builder or other tool that
customers can use to create their own sites using elements that originate from
Tailwind Plus, you’re good to go.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license)..

Can I use Tailwind Plus in open source projects?

Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a
derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the
primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's
totally okay for that project to be open source.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

Can I sell templates/themes I build with Tailwind Plus?

No, you cannot use Tailwind Plus to create derivative products like themes, UI
kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and
redistributing our components or templates for someone else to use to build
their own sites.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

### Support

Do you offer technical support?

Tailwind Plus is a self-serve product, meaning that while we do offer customer
support for account management and licensing related concerns, the expectation
is that customers have the requisite knowledge of Tailwind CSS, HTML, React,
and Vue to use the product successfully.

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces
of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not
offer technical support or consulting**.

What is your refund policy?

If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at
[support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com) within 30 days and
we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.

### General

What does “lifetime access” mean exactly?

Buying a Tailwind Plus license is a **one-time purchase, with no recurring
subscription**. When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access to
everything in Tailwind Plus forever.

What does “free updates” include?

When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access to every component
package and every site template available today, plus any additional component
packages or templates we release in the future at no additional cost.

This means that if we add a brand new component package like “Journalism” or
design a new social media website template, access to those products are
included in your original purchase.

To get an idea of what updates have looked like in the past, [check out our
changelog](/plus/changelog).

Do you offer student or purchasing power parity discounts?

For situations where price is an issue, we offer a discounted restricted
license you can purchase if either:

  * You are a student using Tailwind Plus purely for educational purposes, or
  * You are an individual using Tailwind Plus for commercial projects and your annual personal income from all sources **does not exceed $30,000 USD**

To purchase a discounted restricted license, email us at
[support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com).

### Compatibility

Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?

No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.

We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our own design and
development process, so building these extra resources means we can't spend as
much time creating new components and templates in code which is where we
believe we can provide the most value.

What JS framework is used?

Our [website templates](/plus/templates) are built using Next.js, so all of
the markup is written using React.

Our [components](/plus/ui-blocks) are provided in three formats: React, Vue,
and vanilla HTML.

The React and Vue examples are fully interactive, and are powered by [Headless
UI](https://headlessui.dev) — a library of unstyled components we designed to
integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.

The vanilla HTML examples **do not include any JavaScript** and are designed
for people who prefer to write any necessary JavaScript themselves.

Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the ones that do
(dropdowns, dialogs, etc.) we've provided some simple comments in the HTML to
explain things like what classes you need to use for different states (like a
toggle switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for transitioning
elements on to or off of the screen (like a dialog opening).

To get a better idea of how this looks in practice, [check out our
documentation](/plus/ui-blocks/documentation#using-html).

What version of Tailwind CSS is used?

Everything in Tailwind Plus is designed and developed for the latest version
of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.1.

What browsers are supported?

The components and templates in Tailwind Plus are designed to work in the
latest, stable releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, and Edge.

We don't support Internet Explorer 11.

### Licensing

Do I need to purchase a license for each project I work on?

Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new Tailwind Plus
license every time you want to use it on a new project.

As long as what you're building is allowed as per the license, you can build
as many sites as you want without ever having to buy an additional license.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for client projects?

Yes! As long what you're building is a custom website developed for a single
client, you can totally use components and templates in Tailwind Plus to help
build it.

The only thing you can't do is use Tailwind Plus to build a website or
template that is resold to multiple clients.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for my own commercial projects?

Absolutely! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own
projects as you like, whether those are simple public websites or SaaS
applications that end users need to pay to access.

As long as what you’re building isn’t a website builder or other tool that
customers can use to create their own sites using elements that originate from
Tailwind Plus, you’re good to go.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus in open source projects?

Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a
derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the
primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's
totally okay for that project to be open source.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

Can I sell templates/themes I build with Tailwind Plus?

No, you cannot use Tailwind Plus to create derivative products like themes, UI
kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and
redistributing our components or templates for someone else to use to build
their own sites.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

Can I upgrade to a team license later?

Yup! If you're a solo developer you can start with a regular license, and then
upgrade to the team license later if other developers join your team.

There is an "Upgrade to Team License" option under the "Account" menu after
logging in.

Can I purchase a team license that includes more than 25 seats?

In general, if you need more than 25 seats we recommend purchasing multiple
team licenses — one for each team at your company who needs access.

For example, if you run an ecommerce business, you might purchase a team
license for the storefront team, then down the road another team license for
the marketing team, then another for the data science team, and so on.

If you need more than 25 seats because you're a large agency or other type of
company that isn't really organized into separate divisions/teams, contact us
at [support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com) for large team
pricing.

### Support

Do you offer technical support?

Tailwind Plus is a self-serve product, meaning that while we do offer customer
support for things like account management and licensing related concerns, the
expectation is that customers have the requisite knowledge of Tailwind CSS,
HTML, React, and Vue to use the product successfully.

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces
of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not
offer technical support or consulting**.

What is your refund policy?

If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at
[support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com) within 30 days and
we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.

# Meet Catalyst, a beautiful, UI kit built with React and Tailwind CSS

React

Headless UI

Move as fast as you can with a UI library without compromising on your own
vision with modern UI components that are part of your own codebase.

[Documentation](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs)Get UI kit

## Every pixel designed with intent

Not too trendy, not too plain — Catalyst finds the perfect middle ground,
blending depth, clarity, and motion into an interface that’s as intuitive as
it is beautiful.

[Live preview](https://catalyst-demo.tailwindui.com)

![](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/templates/catalyst/screenshot.png)

Built for developers

## What’s included

Catalyst is a modern application UI kit built with Tailwind CSS, Headless UI
and React, designed and built by the Tailwind CSS team. It's a collection of
beautiful, production-ready UI components you drop into your projects
alongside your own code that are yours to customize, adapt, and make your own.

Skip all the time you'd spend building your own buttons, form controls,
dialogs, tables, dropdown menus, and more and hit the ground running with
carefully crafted component APIs that are a delight to use.

**Built by experts** — you can trust that all of the code is written following
Tailwind CSS best practices, because it’s written by the same team who created
and maintain the framework.

**Easy to customize** — everything is styled with utility classes, directly in
the component markup. No configuration variables or complex CSS to wrestle
with, just open any component in your editor and change whatever you want.

**Built with React** — well-structured, thoughtfully designed React
components, built by experts with years of React experience. Benefit from the
strength and maturity of the React ecosystem.

**Keyboard accessible** — everything we build is keyboard accessible, and we
carefully craft the markup to deliver the best screenreader experience we know
how.

**TypeScript or JavaScript** — authored with the latest version of TypeScript
by nerds who get way too much satisfaction out of getting the types just
right. We also include a plain JavaScript version, just in case TypeScript
isn't your thing.

**Your components, not ours** — Catalyst isn’t an npm package you install.
Instead, you download a ZIP file with the React components and add them
directly to your project alongside your own code.

## The technology

Catalyst was thoughtfully crafted with the latest and greatest versions of the
tools we love so that they are easy to maintain, and fun to actually work on.

  * **Tailwind CSS** v4.1
  * **React** v18
  * **Headless UI** v2.1
  * **TypeScript** v5.3

## A starter kit for building your own component systems

Catalyst gives you the perfect foundation for your own component system —
production-ready React components with thoughtfully designed APIs designed to
be copied into your codebase and fully yours to customize.

## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know.

### General

What does “lifetime access” mean exactly?

Tailwind Plus products are a **one-time purchase, with no recurring
subscription**. When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, you have access
to all of the content in that product forever.

What does “free updates” include?

When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, any improvements we make to that
product will always be free for anyone who owns that product.

**Individual templates:** When you buy an individual template, any
improvements we make to that template will be available to you as part of your
original purchase.

So if we fix a bug or upgrade the template to use the latest version of
Tailwind CSS or Next.js, you can download an updated version of the template
free of charge.

Any _new_ templates we release are considered separate products, and can be
purchased separately.

**Tailwind Plus:** When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access
to every site template available _and_ every component package available
today, plus any new templates or component packages we release in the future
at no additional cost.

This means that if we add a brand new social media website template or new
component package like “Journalism”, access to those products are included in
your original purchase, with no upgrade cost.

### Compatibility

Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?

No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.

## Every pixel designed with intent

Not too trendy, not too plain — Catalyst finds the perfect middle ground,
blending depth, clarity, and motion into an interface that’s as intuitive as
it is beautiful.

Built for developers

## What’s included

Catalyst is a modern application UI kit built with Tailwind CSS, Headless UI
and React, designed and built by the Tailwind CSS team. It's a collection of
beautiful, production-ready UI components you drop into your projects
alongside your own code that are yours to customize, adapt, and make your own.

Skip all the time you'd spend building your own buttons, form controls,
dialogs, tables, dropdown menus, and more and hit the ground running with
carefully crafted component APIs that are a delight to use.

**Built by experts** — you can trust that all of the code is written following
Tailwind CSS best practices, because it’s written by the same team who created
and maintain the framework.

**Easy to customize** — everything is styled with utility classes, directly in
the component markup. No configuration variables or complex CSS to wrestle
with, just open any component in your editor and change whatever you want.

**Built with React** — well-structured, thoughtfully designed React
components, built by experts with years of React experience. Benefit from the
strength and maturity of the React ecosystem.

**Keyboard accessible** — everything we build is keyboard accessible, and we
carefully craft the markup to deliver the best screenreader experience we know
how.

**TypeScript or JavaScript** — authored with the latest version of TypeScript
by nerds who get way too much satisfaction out of getting the types just
right. We also include a plain JavaScript version, just in case TypeScript
isn't your thing.

**Your components, not ours** — Catalyst isn’t an npm package you install.
Instead, you download a ZIP file with the React components and add them
directly to your project alongside your own code.

## The technology

Catalyst was thoughtfully crafted with the latest and greatest versions of the
tools we love so that they are easy to maintain, and fun to actually work on.

  * **Tailwind CSS** v4.1
  * **React** v18
  * **Headless UI** v2.1
  * **TypeScript** v5.3

## A starter kit for building your own component systems

Catalyst gives you the perfect foundation for your own component system —
production-ready React components with thoughtfully designed APIs designed to
be copied into your codebase and fully yours to customize.

## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know.

### General

What does “lifetime access” mean exactly?

Tailwind Plus products are a **one-time purchase, with no recurring
subscription**. When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, you have access
to all of the content in that product forever.

What does “free updates” include?

When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, any improvements we make to that
product will always be free for anyone who owns that product.

**Individual templates:** When you buy an individual template, any
improvements we make to that template will be available to you as part of your
original purchase.

So if we fix a bug or upgrade the template to use the latest version of
Tailwind CSS or Next.js, you can download an updated version of the template
free of charge.

Any _new_ templates we release are considered separate products, and can be
purchased separately.

**Tailwind Plus:** When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access
to every site template available _and_ every component package available
today, plus any new templates or component packages we release in the future
at no additional cost.

This means that if we add a brand new social media website template or new
component package like “Journalism”, access to those products are included in
your original purchase, with no upgrade cost.

### Compatibility

Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?

No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.

We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our own design and
development process, so building these extra resources means we can't spend as
much time creating new components and templates in code which is where we
believe we can provide the most value.

What JS framework is used?

Our website templates are built using Next.js, so all of the markup is written
using React.

What version of Tailwind CSS is used?

Everything in Tailwind Plus is designed and developed for the latest version
of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.1.

What browsers are supported?

The components and templates in Tailwind Plus are designed to work in the
latest, stable releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, and Edge.

We don't support Internet Explorer 11.

### Licensing

Do I need to purchase a license for each project I work on?

Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new Tailwind Plus
license every time you want to use it on a new project.

As long as what you're building is allowed as per the license, you can build
as many sites as you want without ever having to buy an additional license.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for client projects?

Yes! As long what you're building is a custom website developed for a single
client, you can totally use components and templates in Tailwind Plus to help
build it.

The only thing you can't do is use Tailwind Plus to build a website or
template that is resold to multiple clients.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for my own commercial projects?

Absolutely! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own
projects as you like, whether those are simple public websites or SaaS
applications that end users need to pay to access.

As long as what you’re building isn’t a website builder or other tool that
customers can use to create their own sites using elements that originate from
Tailwind Plus, you’re good to go.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus in open source projects?

Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a
derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the
primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's
totally okay for that project to be open source.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

Can I sell templates/themes I build with Tailwind Plus?

No, you cannot use Tailwind Plus to create derivative products like themes, UI
kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and
redistributing our components or templates for someone else to use to build
their own sites.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

### Support

Do you offer technical support?

Tailwind Plus is a self-serve product, meaning that while we do offer customer
support for things like account management and licensing related concerns, the
expectation is that customers have the requisite knowledge of Tailwind CSS,
HTML, React, and Vue to use the product successfully.

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces
of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not
offer technical support or consulting**.

What is your refund policy?

If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at
[support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com) within 30 days and
we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.

## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know.

### General

What does “lifetime access” mean exactly?

Tailwind Plus products are a **one-time purchase, with no recurring
subscription**. When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, you have access
to all of the content in that product forever.

What does “free updates” include?

When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, any improvements we make or new
content we add to that product will always be free for anyone who owns that
product.

**Individual component packages:** When you buy the Marketing, Application UI,
or Ecommerce component packages individually, you'll get any new components we
add to those packages in the future at no extra cost.

We regularly add new components to these packages whenever we have new ideas,
and you can see what previous updates have looked like [in our
changelog](/plus/changelog).

Any _new_ component packages we release are considered separate products, and
can be purchased at an upgrade price.

**Tailwind Plus:** When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access
to every component package _and_ every site template available today, plus any
additional component packages or templates we release in the future at no
additional cost.

This means that if we add a brand new component package like “Journalism” or
design a new social media website template, access to those products are
included in your original purchase, with no upgrade cost.

### Compatibility

Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?

No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.

We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our own design and
development process, so building these extra resources means we can't spend as
much time creating new examples in code which is where we believe we can
provide the most value.

What JS framework is used?

All of the components in Tailwind Plus are provided in three formats: React,
Vue, and vanilla HTML.

The React and Vue examples are fully functional out-of-the-box, and are
powered by [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev) — a library of unstyled
components we designed to integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.

The vanilla HTML examples **do not include any JavaScript** and are designed
for people who prefer to write any necessary JavaScript themselves.

Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the ones that do
(dropdowns, dialogs, etc.) we've provided some simple comments in the HTML to
explain things like what classes you need to use for different states (like a
toggle switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for transitioning
elements on to or off of the screen (like a dialog opening).

To get a better idea of how this looks in practice, [check out our
documentation](/plus/ui-blocks/documentation#using-html).

What version of Tailwind CSS is used?

Everything in Tailwind Plus is designed and developed for the latest version
of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.1.

What browsers are supported?

The components in Tailwind Plus are designed to work in the latest, stable
releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

We don't support Internet Explorer 11.

### Licensing

Can I upgrade to a team license later?

Yup! If you're a solo developer you can start with a personal license, and
then upgrade to the team license later if other developers join your team.

There is an "Upgrade to Team License" option under the "Account" menu after
logging in.

Note that we only offer team licenses for Tailwind Plus, and do not offer team
licenses for the individual component packages.

Do I need to purchase a license for each project I work on?

Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new Tailwind Plus
license every time you want to use it on a new project.

As long as what you're building is allowed as per the license, you can build
as many sites as you want without ever having to buy an additional license.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for client projects?

Yes! As long what you're building is a custom website developed for a single
client, you can totally use components and templates in Tailwind Plus to help
build it.

The only thing you can't do is use Tailwind Plus to build a website or
template that is resold to multiple clients.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for my own commercial projects?

Absolutely! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own
projects as you like, whether those are simple public websites or SaaS
applications that end users need to pay to access.

As long as what you’re building isn’t a website builder or other tool that
customers can use to create their own sites using elements that originate from
Tailwind Plus, you’re good to go.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license)..

Can I use Tailwind Plus in open source projects?

Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a
derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the
primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's
totally okay for that project to be open source.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

Can I sell templates/themes I build with Tailwind Plus?

No, you cannot use Tailwind Plus to create derivative products like themes, UI
kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and
redistributing our components or templates for someone else to use to build
their own sites.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

### Support

Do you offer technical support?

Tailwind Plus is a self-serve product, meaning that while we do offer customer
support for account management and licensing related concerns, the expectation
is that customers have the requisite knowledge of Tailwind CSS, HTML, React,
and Vue to use the product successfully.

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces
of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not
offer technical support or consulting**.

What is your refund policy?

If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at
[support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com) within 30 days and
we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.

## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know.

### General

What does “lifetime access” mean exactly?

Buying a Tailwind Plus license is a **one-time purchase, with no recurring
subscription**. When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access to
everything in Tailwind Plus forever.

What does “free updates” include?

When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access to every component
package and every site template available today, plus any additional component
packages or templates we release in the future at no additional cost.

This means that if we add a brand new component package like “Journalism” or
design a new social media website template, access to those products are
included in your original purchase.

To get an idea of what updates have looked like in the past, [check out our
changelog](/plus/changelog).

Do you offer student or purchasing power parity discounts?

For situations where price is an issue, we offer a discounted restricted
license you can purchase if either:

  * You are a student using Tailwind Plus purely for educational purposes, or
  * You are an individual using Tailwind Plus for commercial projects and your annual personal income from all sources **does not exceed $30,000 USD**

To purchase a discounted restricted license, email us at
[support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com).

### Compatibility

Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?

No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.

We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our own design and
development process, so building these extra resources means we can't spend as
much time creating new components and templates in code which is where we
believe we can provide the most value.

What JS framework is used?

Our [website templates](/plus/templates) are built using Next.js, so all of
the markup is written using React.

Our [components](/plus/ui-blocks) are provided in three formats: React, Vue,
and vanilla HTML.

The React and Vue examples are fully interactive, and are powered by [Headless
UI](https://headlessui.dev) — a library of unstyled components we designed to
integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.

The vanilla HTML examples **do not include any JavaScript** and are designed
for people who prefer to write any necessary JavaScript themselves.

Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the ones that do
(dropdowns, dialogs, etc.) we've provided some simple comments in the HTML to
explain things like what classes you need to use for different states (like a
toggle switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for transitioning
elements on to or off of the screen (like a dialog opening).

To get a better idea of how this looks in practice, [check out our
documentation](/plus/ui-blocks/documentation#using-html).

What version of Tailwind CSS is used?

Everything in Tailwind Plus is designed and developed for the latest version
of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.1.

What browsers are supported?

The components and templates in Tailwind Plus are designed to work in the
latest, stable releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, and Edge.

We don't support Internet Explorer 11.

### Licensing

Do I need to purchase a license for each project I work on?

Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new Tailwind Plus
license every time you want to use it on a new project.

As long as what you're building is allowed as per the license, you can build
as many sites as you want without ever having to buy an additional license.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for client projects?

Yes! As long what you're building is a custom website developed for a single
client, you can totally use components and templates in Tailwind Plus to help
build it.

The only thing you can't do is use Tailwind Plus to build a website or
template that is resold to multiple clients.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for my own commercial projects?

Absolutely! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own
projects as you like, whether those are simple public websites or SaaS
applications that end users need to pay to access.

As long as what you’re building isn’t a website builder or other tool that
customers can use to create their own sites using elements that originate from
Tailwind Plus, you’re good to go.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus in open source projects?

Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a
derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the
primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's
totally okay for that project to be open source.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

Can I sell templates/themes I build with Tailwind Plus?

No, you cannot use Tailwind Plus to create derivative products like themes, UI
kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and
redistributing our components or templates for someone else to use to build
their own sites.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our
license](/plus/license).

Can I upgrade to a team license later?

Yup! If you're a solo developer you can start with a regular license, and then
upgrade to the team license later if other developers join your team.

There is an "Upgrade to Team License" option under the "Account" menu after
logging in.

Can I purchase a team license that includes more than 25 seats?

In general, if you need more than 25 seats we recommend purchasing multiple
team licenses — one for each team at your company who needs access.

For example, if you run an ecommerce business, you might purchase a team
license for the storefront team, then down the road another team license for
the marketing team, then another for the data science team, and so on.

If you need more than 25 seats because you're a large agency or other type of
company that isn't really organized into separate divisions/teams, contact us
at [support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com) for large team
pricing.

### Support

Do you offer technical support?

Tailwind Plus is a self-serve product, meaning that while we do offer customer
support for things like account management and licensing related concerns, the
expectation is that customers have the requisite knowledge of Tailwind CSS,
HTML, React, and Vue to use the product successfully.

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces
of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not
offer technical support or consulting**.

What is your refund policy?

If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at
[support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com) within 30 days and
we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.
